# Thought Process for xv6 `xargs`

## 1. Understanding the Problem
- **What xargs does in Unix**:

    It takes a command (like `echo bye`) and then reads text from **stdin**. For each chunk of text (line, or words depending on options), it appends that text as arguments to the command and executes the command.

- **Simplification for xv6**:

    - We don't need batching optimizations (=grouping many stdin arguments together into one exec call).
    - Requirement: one line of stdin -> one exec.
    - Each word in the line should become its own argument.
- **Key Example**:
    ```
    echo hello too | xargs echo bye
    ```
    - Command part = `echo bye`.
    - Input line = `hello too`.
    - Full command run = `echo bye hello too`.
    - Output = `bye hello too`.

So, essentially:
    Input text from **stdin** gets spliced into argv[] after the command's arguments.

## 2. Breaking Down the Tasks
(a) Parse the command itself
The command to run is everything that comes after `xargs` in argv.
- In `xargs echo bye`, argv is `{ "xargs", "echo", "bye" }`.
- So the fixed base command is `{ "echo", "bye" }`.

(b) Read from **stdin**
- In xv6, ***stdin** is just file descriptor 0*.
- Becase of the shell's pipe (`|`), **stdin** is actually connected to the previous program's **stdout**.
- Reading stdin line by line means:
    - Keep calling `read(0, &c, 1)`,
    - Accumulate into a buffer until `\n`.
    - That's one unit of input.

(c) Split input into words.
- Each line can contain multiple words (e.g. `"hello too"`).
- So we need a simple parser:
    - Walk the line character by character.
    - Words are separated by spaces/tabs.
    - Replace whitespace with `\0` to terminate C-strings.
    - Collect pointers to the start of each word.

(d) Construct argv[]
- Take the base command arguments.
- Append the words parsed from input.
- Terminate with `\0`.
- Example:
    - Base = `{ "echo", "bye" }`.
    - Extra = `{ "hello", "too" }`.
    - Full argv = `{ "echo", "bye", "hello", "too", 0 }`.

(e) Run the command
- Fork a child.
- In child: `exec(argv[0], argv);` -> replaces child with the command.
- In parent: `wait(0);` -> wait until child is done.
- Repeat for next line.

## 3. Edge Cases to Consider
- Too many arguments -> must not exceed `MAXARG`.
- Long lines -> input buffer overflow.
- Empty lines -> probably should skip.
- EOF without `\n` -> process last line anyway.

## 4. Connecting with the Pipe
It's important for remind ourselves:
- `xargs` doesn't know about the left side of the pipe.
- It just reads **stdin**.
- The shell (sh in xv6) already did `pipe()`, `fork()`, and `dup()` to connect stdout of the left process to stdin of `xargs`.

So as far as `xargs` is concerned, stdin looks like a file where someone is writing lines. 
```
Visualization of dup()
Process fd table:
   fd=3  --->  struct file (inode=/foo, offset=42, ref=2)
   fd=4  ---^

dup(3) returned 4
```
